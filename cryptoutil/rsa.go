// GenerateRSAKeyWithHMACDRBG generates an RSA key with a deterministic random bit generator, seeded
// with entropy from the provided random source.  Some random bit sources are quite slow, for example
// HSMs with true RNGs can take 500ms to produce enough bits to generate a single number
// to test for primality, taking literally minutes to succeed in generating a key.  As an example, when
// testing this function, one run took 921 attempts to generate a 2048 bit RSA key, which would have taken
// over 7 minutes on a Thales HSM.
//
// Instead, this function seeds a DRBG (specifically HMAC-DRBG from NIST SP800-90a) with
// entropy from a random source, then uses the output of that DRBG to generate candidate primes.
// This is still secure as the output of a DRBG is secure if the seed is sufficiently random, and
// an attacker cannot predict which numbers are chosen for primes if they don't have access to the seed.
// Additionally, the seed in this case is quite large indeed, 1000 bits, well above what could be brute
// forced.

// This is a sanctioned approach from FIPS 186-4 (B.3.2)
